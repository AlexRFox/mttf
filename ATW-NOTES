mttf-add is designed to build the initialization json object and place
it on the queue, set to run immediatedly. mttf-add records the script
name, parses the recurrence pattern and places all of it's positional
arguments in a json array called args, for the script to pick up and
deal with. Until the queue is developed, mttf-add simply builds the
json object, prints it out and returns.
